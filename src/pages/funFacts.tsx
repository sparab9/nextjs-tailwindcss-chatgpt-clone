During a summer internship in Detroit, Shreyas could oftentimes be found busking or street performing for tips. Shreyas started juggling after seeing a barefoot math PhD student juggling in the quad and decided those were the people he wanted to be around. Although his skills leave much to desire, Shreyas finds juggling therapeutic and relaxing. Shreyas' enthusiasm for juggling stems from his hidden curiousities in physics, math, biology, and neuroscience. Shreyas' favorite trick (although he is rusty on it) was juggling three staplers and stapling documents mid-juggle.'
